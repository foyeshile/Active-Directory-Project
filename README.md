# Active-Directory-Project
This project demonstrates my ability to deploy and manage a Windows Server Active Directory environment, configure user accounts and group policies, and get an understanding of how Active Directory works. The goal was to simulate real-world IT Support and System Administration tasks focused on user management, security, and system efficiency.
